# Walkthrough on opening the project.
Extract the zip file on to a folder, <br>
After extracting, open the folder and open "test" folder, <br>
Next open the folder "src" continue with "com", then "company" <br>
And finally you can open the code data with a JDK application, and run the app! :D
<br><br>

PS. the app is not completely done due to deadline, though with the right adjustments it can be a fully functional app.
